thoughts of mechanics, the first mechanic i made was a wave mechanic this mechanic would set the amount of enemys and instanciate them on the right path afterwards i began making the tower placement so you could place the towers the main idea was that you would have circles on the ground that would light up when hovered over and when clicked you would get a menu of wich tower you would want to choose after the placements was the towers themself setting the range they would have making them shoot and making them have cooldown. afterwards i made the bullets some had a special effect like the wizard who's fireball would explode on contact with the enemy dealing aoi damage or the druid who's attack would also explode after contact with the enemy with would slow the enemies down for a few second.
